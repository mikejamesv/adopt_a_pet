Adopt a pet is a pet adoption website where you can browse through categories of animals and pick which one you want to adopt.
By clicking a category, it will route you to a list of available pets for adoption and you can see the pet's profile which contains the pet's information such as age, breed, and photos.
The website also allows you to register a pet for adoption.
